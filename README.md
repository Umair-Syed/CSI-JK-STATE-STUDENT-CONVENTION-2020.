<b>Note:</b> This app is not fully tested so unexpected behaviour may occur in some devices.

<h2>Spam detection</h2>
A sophisticated system is built to detect spam reviews. Detection process involves two phases
<ol>
  <li>Logically detecting if user has reviewed multiple times on the same product</li>
  <li>Machine learning classification model (using Tensorflow lite) is used to analyze text and classify review into <i>truthful</i> or <i>deceptive</i>.
      Dataset is downloaded from Kaggle</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>If a review is detected as spam in both the phases, then review is confirmed to be spam and <b>Alert Notification</b> is show to admin.
  If review is detected as spam in anyone of the phase, then review is marked as <i>potential spam</i> and admin is notified.</blockquote>
